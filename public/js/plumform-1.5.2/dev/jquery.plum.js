	 * Plum plugins love AJAX, and it's always awesome to not have the need to call a
	 * plugin again when a new page has been loaded with AJAX. This can be accomplished
	 * by listening to DOM mutation events. Unfortunately, DOMNodeInserted is not
	 * supported in IE 7 and 8, and has been deprecated by the W3C (meaning future
	 * browsers may also not support it). A forceful workaround is to play with jQuery's
	 * DOM mutation methods to trigger a custom event.
